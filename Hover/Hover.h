#  This is the library for Hover. 
#  
#  Hover is a development kit that lets you control your hardware projects in a whole new way.  
#  Wave goodbye to physical buttons. Hover detects hand movements in the air for touch-less interaction.  
#  It also features five touch-sensitive regions for even more options.
#  Hover uses I2C and 2 digital pins. It is compatible with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and more.
#
#  Hover can be purchased here: http://www.justhover.com

#
#  INSTALLATION
#  The 3 library files (Hover.cpp, Hover.h and keywords.txt) in the Hover folder should be placed in your Arduino Library folder.
#  Run the HoverDemo.ino file from your Arduino IDE.
